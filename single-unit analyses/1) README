%% Prior to usage, you must preprocess your data. 

The scripts and functions in this folder should be used a scaffold to guide writing of your own, unless data
is formatted the same as mine (John) was.

You can find other iterations of scripts and functions and some other things I've analyzed by going to the following
directories:

    X:\03. Lab Procedures and Protocols\MATLABToolbox\John code and edits\Linear Classifier
    X:\03. Lab Procedures and Protocols\MATLABToolbox\John code and edits\Firing Rate
    
You can also find scripts and functions Henry or Andrew wrote by going to the following directories:

    X:\03. Lab Procedures and Protocols\MATLABToolbox\Henry Code
    X:\03. Lab Procedures and Protocols\MATLABToolbox\Andrew code
    
I only uploaded my own since I'm most familiar with them.

Some important notes:

    You will notice two functions named something like 'get_inputs'. Prior to use of any scripts or functions that 
    require the get_input.m function, you will need to open get_inputs.m and change the variables of interest.
    
    All svm analyses utilized the svmlib toolbox
    
    
To use:
    1) you will need all files converted. The way to convert files can be found in the preprocessing folder
