%% testing if lfp is sampled at the same time
% using NlxGetNewCSCData back to back could sample things at the same time,
% or it could have a small offset. This code was designed to answer that
% question.
%
% In order to replicate, please play the test_theta .WAV file through the
% signal mouse and acquire the data with cheetah.
%
% If you see a drastic drop in the first few samples of the graph, it's
% because the connect2netcom function starts and stops the acquisition
