Steps from pretraining to experimentation

1) handle
2) goal box (manual)
3) forced runs variable delay (FR_training_variableDelay.m)
4) Spatial reversal training (3days, two reversals; SpatialReversalTask)
5) Spatial delayed reversal training (3days, two reversals; DelayedSpatialReversalTask)

Same day (prior to testing)
6) baselineDetect_SRT
7) defineThetaThresholds_SRT
6) Coherence triggered reversal training
