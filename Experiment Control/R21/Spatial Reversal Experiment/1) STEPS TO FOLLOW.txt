Steps from pretraining to experimentation

1) handle
2) goal box (manual)
3) forced runs variable delay (FR_training_variableDelay.m)
4) Spatial reversal training (3days, two reversals; SpatialReversalTask)
5) Spatial delayed reversal training (3days, two reversals; DelayedSpatialReversalTask)

Same day (prior to testing)
6) baselineDetect_SRT
7) defineThetaThresholds_SRT
8) Run RandomizeConditions
9) If day 1, run testingCoherence_DelayedSpatialReversalTask
->>>> you MUST know the previous days "traj" variable. Just look in their folder


IMPORTANT:::::
Testing MUST occur exactly 1 day after the final training day.
Testing MUST occur in a consecutive 8 day streak.
