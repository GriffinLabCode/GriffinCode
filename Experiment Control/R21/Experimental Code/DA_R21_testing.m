%% coherence trial presentation
% rats behaviors vary wildly day to day and they're having trouble learning
% the DA variable delay task.

% therefore, what we will do is after 2 weeks of training, we will start
% testing. And testing will look like this:
%   1) Rats are run for 8 days on 24 trials or 30 minutes
%   2) Rats are then switched to running for 30 minutes with no trial limit
%   3) After 10 days, rats will be run on DA with coh detect running, and
%   once 80% is reached on 6 consecutive trials, coherence testing will
%   begin. We will present choices after a delay coherence high or a bowl
%   coherence high. This will be determined by finding the upper end SEM
%   during delay for high coherence, and lower end SEM for bowl coherence.
%
%   - high coherence, low coherence, and control trials will be presented
%   at random throughout the session. But, this will only happen so long as
%   there is at least 10 minutes remaining in the session
