Int_file description: The int file is a matrix composed of time-stamps that give the user an approximation for when the animal
                      entered certain locations. The rows indicate maze-traversals - for the DNMP task, odd rows are sample
                      runs, even rows are choice runs. Every group of two rows indicates 1 trial. The columns indicate maze
                      positions that we've deemed relevant. To demonstrate these two points: Int(1,1) is the time during the first
                      trial, on the first sample run, at stem entry. Below is a description of what each column indicates:
