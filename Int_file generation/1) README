Int_file description: The int file is a matrix composed of time-stamps that give the user an approximation for when the animal
                      entered certain locations. The rows indicate maze-traversals - for the DNMP task, odd rows are sample
                      runs, even rows are choice runs. Every group of two rows indicates 1 trial. The columns indicate maze
                      positions that we've deemed relevant. To demonstrate these two points: Int(1,1) is the time during the first
                      trial, on the first sample run, at stem entry. Below is a description of what each column indicates in the order
                      that the rat runs the maze. Note that columns are out of order - this was inherited and could be fixed in future
                      releases:
                      
                      Column 1: stem entry (AKA start-box exit)
                      Column 5: stem exit (AKA t-junction entry)
                      Column 6: t-junction exit
                      Column 2: goal-zone entry
                      Column 7: goal-zone exit (AKA return-arm entry)
                      Column 8: start-box entry (AKA return-arm exit)
                      
                      Column 3: trajectory where 1s are left turns and 0s are right turns
                      Column 4: behavioral accuracy where 1s are incorrect trials and 0s are correct.
                                Note that for column 4, an incorrect trial will have 1s on both the sample
                                and choice runs

Steps for generating the Int file:

    1) Convert your position data to .mat files by running NL2Mat_complete_short.m - note you will have to define
       your session directory, named 'datafolder'. Also note that NL2Mat_complete_short.m utilizes neuralynx code
       that is note shared on this website. To access it, copy and paste the following directory into the file
       explorer window: 
       
                              X:\03. Lab Procedures and Protocols\MATLABToolbox\Nlx2Mat
       
    2) After you have converted your video-tracking data (VT1.mat), you open the Int_DNMP_master.m script and define 
       whether you want to interpolate missing video-tracking data.
              - We advise to interpolate the missing data. To see for yourself, don't interpolate the data, go through
                the rest of the instructions here, open the check_int.m script, define the same parameters for maze
                locations, and run the script. What you will find is there are cases where the camera loses the rat,
                causing inappropriate time-stamps to be defined as a maze location. For example, you may define the 
                t-junction and get the time-stamps for when the animal entered the t-junction, but if the camera lost
                the animal, then picked him back up after t-junction entry, your t-junction entry time-stamp will be
                beyond t-junction entry and therefore not accurately depicting what you defined.
