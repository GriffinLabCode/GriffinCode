# Some code used for a variety of analyses in the Griffin lab

VERY IMPORTANT FOR USERS RECORDING FROM MULTIPLE REGIONS:
Future users who record single-units from multiple regions should not store data separately in
folders as I (John) did. Instead, save the region single-units under specific .txt files. For
example: if you recorded 10 units from mPFC and 10 from hippocampus, you should name the saved
.txt something like 'mPFC_...' and 'hpc_...' instead of them all starting with 'TT...'with the 
dots indicating the rest of the name. Then when you go to load the TT files, you can specify
to load the specific region based on the TT name, instead of based on an entirely different folder.
This saves space and is more organized.
