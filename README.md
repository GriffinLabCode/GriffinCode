# Analysis code and an online protocol for converting files

For new users: Make sure to start out in the 'basic functions and scripts' folders. You will
               want to convert your CSC and video-tracking files prior to analysis. If using a
               t-maze, you will want to generate an Int file. Most analysis scripts are made
               with the intentions of use with the Int file but can be modified to fit your
               needs.

IMPORTANT FOR USERS RECORDING FROM MULTIPLE REGIONS:
Future users who record single-units from multiple regions should not store data separately in
folders as I (John) did. Instead, save the region single-units under specific .txt files. For
example: if you recorded 10 units from mPFC and 10 from hippocampus, you should name the saved
.txt something like 'mPFC_...' and 'hpc_...' instead of them all starting with 'TT...'with the 
dots indicating the rest of the name. Then when you go to load the TT files, you can specify
to load the specific region based on the TT name, instead of based on an entirely different folder.
This saves space and is more organized.
