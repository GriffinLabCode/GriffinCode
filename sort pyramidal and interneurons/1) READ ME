Traditionally, the lab determines pyramidal cells from interneurons based on a variety of features:
      1) spike width: pyramidal neurons tend to have a longer spike width
      2) mean firing-rate: interneurons tend to have a higher mean firing-rate
      3) interspike interval: this is visually inspected on spikesort3D (neuralynx)
      4) waveform shape: similar to spike width, visual identification of shorter action potentials
      
The scripts/ functions in this folder do not sort pyramidal and interneurons, but instead provide metrics to 
quantify what the user has already sorted. Future iterations will be aimed at making this process less manual.
Future scripts and functions will include autocorrelograms for futher identification of pyramidal and interneurons.
