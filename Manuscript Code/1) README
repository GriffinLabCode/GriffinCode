This folder is used for storing code that was used on our 2019 manuscript that examined mPFC single unit activity
during rat DNMP performance and mPFC-Re-dHPC LFP interactions.

Note that not all functions are included in this folder. For example, we didn't include the chronux toolbox and 
BSMART toolbox. However, some other functions can be found in the GriffinCode folders.
