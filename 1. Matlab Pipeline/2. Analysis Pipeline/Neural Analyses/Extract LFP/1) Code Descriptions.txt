For quick/easy access for analysis, use the following to call your data:

getLFPdata: a quick and easy way to extract LFP for analysis. It calls on 'convertLFPdata' and 'getLFPsrate'

preprocessLFP: chronux routine detrending (loess) and cleaning methods.

****
IMPORTANT: make sure you've converted your LFP from a neuralynx to matlab readible format.
		Otherwise, none of these functions will work.

Detailed methods used in the code above

convertLFPdata: Before you analyze, we convert our LFP to a vector.

rateReducerLFP: another way to downsample your LFP. Would recommend this method

________________________
Less recommended, but could try:

downSampleLFPdata: a method to downsample your LFP. Ideally, your LFP will all be sampled at the same rate.
