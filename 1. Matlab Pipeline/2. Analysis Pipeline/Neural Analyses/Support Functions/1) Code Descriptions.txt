Preprocessing things:

detect_clipping: a method to identify clipping artifacts. Recommend to use single trials and not entire signal.

find_downsample_rate: used as first step to downsample your lfp data

skaggs_filter_var: filter lfp 

phase_freq_detect: interpolation method to get theta phases (M. Brandon code)

_________________________
Analysis stuff:

custom_movingWin_template : a template for customizable moving window analyses

get_bestFrequency: identifies the dominating frequency of interest (ie if hpc theta is strongest at 7hz, the best freq. will be 7hz)

Theta_Delta_Ratio: Used to compute theta:delta ratio

TDratioEpochs: I forget**

rat_location_time2pos: tells you where the rat is on maze in the time domain. Not super useful

Other detrending/denoising:
**** It is recommended to use preprocessLFP in the 'Extract LFP' folder ****

polyDetrend: a detrending method using polynomial fitting and subtraction. Works equally well as loess detrending (could be better)

DetrendDenoise: a method for detrending and denoising
