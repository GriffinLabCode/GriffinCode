It is important to note that there are many options for 'cleaning' and detrending your LFP.

The method of your choosing can severely change your results. Therefore, prior to spectral analysis,
you must be inspecting your data to ensure that your procedures are doing what you would expect.

_________________________________
Make sure your data is sampled at a similar sampling rate.

If not, you can filter your data, then downsample your data. 
Do NOT downsample before filtering, or without filtering. You will
induce Aliases in your data.

**Important: Using padcat to create a matrix of LFP data can skew coherence
	estimates near 1 if the data are different sizes.

Typical Rundown of analysis:

1) Run cleaningscript on the entire signal

2) Run detrend_LFP on entire signal
	-> This really helps trim out those low frequency signals

3) Extract epochs of interest into a cell array
	-> I have tried detrending on individual trials. While this works great if the
		signal is long enough, and even gets the average closest to zero, it will
		drastically change your signal if it is less than 1/2 second. Moreover, it
		minimally changes the distribution - most reflect normal distributions, regardless
		of how you detrend. It's just that this changes the data more than the above steps, 
		and can even drop lower freq the power (<15Hz)

4) Run 'detect_clipping' on RAW LFP data. 
	-> do NOT run detect_clipping using detrended data
		----> This is bc detect_clipping identifies clip artifacts, which will become skewed by detrending

5) Remove trials that have artifacts. Extract the trials that you need.

6) Define parameters
	-> params = getCustomParams;
	-> params.tapers   = [3 5];
	-> params.pad      = 1; % or 0
	-> params.Fs       = srate; % YOU MUST DEFINE THIS AS YOUR SAMPLING RATE!!!!!!
	-> params.trialave = 1;

7) Run chronux spectral analysis
