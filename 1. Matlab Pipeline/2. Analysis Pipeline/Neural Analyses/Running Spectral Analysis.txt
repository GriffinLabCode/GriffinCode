It is important to note that there are many options for 'cleaning' and detrending your LFP.

The method of your choosing can severely change your results. Therefore, prior to spectral analysis,
you must be inspecting your data to ensure that your procedures are doing what you would expect.

_________________________________
Make sure your data is sampled at a similar sampling rate.

If not, you can filter your data, then downsample your data. 
Do NOT downsample before filtering, or without filtering. You will
induce Aliases in your data.

Typical Rundown of analysis:

1) Run cleaningscript on the entire signal (it is arguable of whether this is necessary)

2) Extract epochs of interest into a cell array

3) Run 'detrend_LFP' on each trial separately
	-> fitting and subtracting low-order polynomials does a great job at detrending your data
	-> Make sure to visualize the outcome and also ensure that the average of your LFP signal is ~0
	-> If you used a matrix, and you used 'padcat' to combine the data together, or zero-padded your data, 
		detrending will skew your results
		----> MAKE SURE YOUR DATA IS NOT ZERO-PADDED BEFORE DETRENDING!!!!!

4) Run 'detect_clipping' on RAW LFP data. 
	-> do NOT run detect_clipping using detrended data
		----> This is bc detect_clipping identifies clip artifacts, which will become skewed by detrending

5) Remove trials that have artifacts. Extract the trials that you need.

6) Use 'padcat' to make data into a matrix

7) Define parameters
	-> params = getCustomParams;
	-> params.tapers   = [3 5];
	-> params.pad      = 1; % or 0
	-> params.Fs       = srate; % YOU MUST DEFINE THIS AS YOUR SAMPLING RATE!!!!!!
	-> params.trialave = 1;

7) Run chronux spectral analysis
