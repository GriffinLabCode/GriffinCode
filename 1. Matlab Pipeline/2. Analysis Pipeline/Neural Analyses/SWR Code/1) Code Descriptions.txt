IMPORTANT: This code is highly specific to Griffin lab methods and requires an "Int" file
______________________________

get_swrParams: a function to extract parameters needed for SWR code

preSWRfun: Use this before moving forward. This code sets up your data for extrac_SWR

extract_SWR: extracts SWRs using a combination of methods from Jadhav and Buzsaki lab

extract_cleaned_swrs: extracts SWRs and filteres for things like running speed and potential false positives

getFalsePositiveSWRs: uses another electrode wire that should not have SWRs to detect false-positive events. False positives
			could be eating events or high freq. gamma/ noise between wires

Highly specific plotting scripts - these are probably not very generalizable, but could be used
				    for your own coding.
