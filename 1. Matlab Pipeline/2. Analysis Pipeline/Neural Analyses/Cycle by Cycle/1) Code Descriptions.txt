get_thetaPhase: extracts theta phase

get_thetaFeatures: Cycle-by-cycle analysis. Can be used to calculate two methods of
			theta asymmetry, extracts theta cycle periodicity, and cycle amplitudes

get_thetaCycleTimes: used to extract time-stamps in each theta cycle. This could be generalized to 
			extract spikes in theta cycles.

get_thetaCycleGammaPower: An experimental code to compute high gamma to low gamma ratio within theta-cycles

thetaDeltaRatio_cycleXcycle: Code that computes a theta:delta ratio per each theta cycle in consideration

______________________________

Recommended:
	get_thetaCycleTimes is probably the most generalizable code

IMPORTANT: 
	This code is largely new and experimental. Extensive confirmations were performed, however, you should
	know this codes in-and-outs before running
