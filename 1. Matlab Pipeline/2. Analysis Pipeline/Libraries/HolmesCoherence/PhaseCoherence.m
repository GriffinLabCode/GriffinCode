function PC = PhaseCoherence(freq, timeSeries, FS)
% PC = PhaseCoherence(freq, timeSeries, FS)
% 
%   Inputs:
%       freq              	Frequency to be analysed (Hz).
%       timeSeries          Matrix containing time series data. Should be
%                           in the format measurements x time.
%       FS                  Sampling rate value.
%   Outputs:
%       PC                  Phase coherence value at frequency of interest.
% 
%
% This function calculates phase coherence at a frequency of interest 
% across different measurements, i.e. cosistency of phase at a given 
% frequency. The output phase coherence value lies between 0 and 1: 
% 1 indicates perfect phase coherence and 0 indicates no phase coherence.
