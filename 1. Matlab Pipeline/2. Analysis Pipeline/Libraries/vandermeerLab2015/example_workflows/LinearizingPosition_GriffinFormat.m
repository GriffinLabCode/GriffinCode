% BACKGROUND

% Position data is collected by an overhead camera and position tracking 
% algorithm as it views the bright, point source of light emitted by the 
% headstage LEDs. This position data is saved in the Neuralynx .nvt file.

% In the vandermeerlab codebase, position data is loaded using the function
% LoadPos(), and the x and y coordinate positions are accessed using the
% function getd().

% In analyses involving the use of trajectories, it is necessary to store
% the idealized path a rat would take along the track. These idealized
% paths, or coords, are saved for later use in scripts that order place 
% cells based on their field positions on the track.

% This workflow takes you through position data loading and linearizing
% using the example session R050-2014-04-02 recorded in RR1 at UW. R050's
% maze is T-shaped and has one choice point. The end of the left arm has a
% food reward and the end of the right arm has a water reward.

% In reality, R050's maze was oriented such that the top of the T points up. Notice
% here that the T-maze is actually upside down! This is because the camera
% mirrors the data in the Y axis.

% We can set certain axis properties so that the position data is
% plotted in the orientation we want to see it, but at the same time
% preserve the real data points and their relationships to one another:

%% You can also rotate the maze:

figure; plot(pos(1,:),pos(2,:),'.','Color',[0.7 0.7 0.7],'MarkerSize',4); xlabel('x data'); ylabel('y data');
set(gca,'YDir','reverse') % this flips the Y axis
view(270,90); % the number 270 rotates the plot 270 degrees CLOCKWISE
title('Figure rotated AND flipped')

% Note that you can also perform this flip rotation by plotting (y,x), but
% this also transposes the data and works only for mazes that are bilaterally 
% symmetrical in the y axis (I think >_<).

% BACKGROUND INFORMATION

% You might need to load position data in centimeters instead of in units
% of pixels.

% Do do this, you need the real dimensions of your track in cm but these 
% dimensions must be as if the track fits perfectly into a box that has the 
% same orientation as the camera's field of view (the box has to be orthogonal 
% to the field of view, or whatever word it is). See digrams below.

% Furthermore, the dimesions should be measured according to the trajectory
% the rat would have followed, ie: don't measure from one outer edge to the
% opposite outer edge, because the rat doesn't walk along the edge -- he
% walks along the center (unless he's an acrobat or weird).

% rhombus track ex: you don't want lengths a and b, you want x and y

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Here's a quick example of how to linearize the position data. You can
% think of linearizing as "pushing the position data onto the nearest point
% along the coord trajectory". 

% Normally you would have a separate script that defines the trial start
% and stop times; for the sake of this example, here are the trial
% intervals for all right trials that R050 did for the example session:

tstart = Int(Int(:,3)==0,1);
tend   = Int(Int(:,3)==0,8);

trial_iv_R = iv(tstart,tend);

clear tstart tend

%% Load position data in units of centimeters

% do do this, you need to specify conFact as a config field
cfg.convFact = convFact;

pos = LoadPos(cfg);


%% Now, restrict the position data to the right trials only:

pos_R = restrict(pos,trial_iv_R);

% You can plot the output to see what this looks like:
figure; plot(getd(pos_R,'x'),getd(pos_R,'y')); set(gca,'YDir','reverse')

% note that the lines connecting the end of the right arm to the start of
% the track are not actually present in the data...they are just artifacts
% of plotting.
