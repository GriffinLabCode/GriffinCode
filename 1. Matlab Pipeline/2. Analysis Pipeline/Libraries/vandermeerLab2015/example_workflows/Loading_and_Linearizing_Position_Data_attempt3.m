% BACKGROUND

% Position data is collected by an overhead camera and position tracking 
% algorithm as it views the bright, point source of light emitted by the 
% headstage LEDs. This position data is saved in the Neuralynx .nvt file.

% In the vandermeerlab codebase, position data is loaded using the function
% LoadPos(), and the x and y coordinate positions are accessed using the
% function getd().

% In analyses involving the use of trajectories, it is necessary to store
% the idealized path a rat would take along the track. These idealized
% paths, or coords, are saved for later use in scripts that order place 
% cells based on their field positions on the track.

% This workflow takes you through position data loading and linearizing
% using the example session R050-2014-04-02 recorded in RR1 at UW. R050's
% maze is T-shaped and has one choice point. The end of the left arm has a
% food reward and the end of the right arm has a water reward.

% using an empty config loads the position data in the default units of pixels:
cfg = [];

% load the position data using LoadPos()
pos = LoadPos(cfg);

%% plot the position data

% position data is accessed using the function getd()
% if you want the x data points, x = getd(pos,'x');
figure; plot(getd(pos,'x'),getd(pos,'y'),'.','Color',[0.7 0.7 0.7],'MarkerSize',4); xlabel('x data'); ylabel('y data');
title('This maze is upside down!')

% In reality, R050's maze was oriented such that the top of the T points up. Notice
% here that the T-maze is actually upside down! This is because the camera
% mirrors the data in the Y axis.

% We can set certain axis properties so that the position data is
% plotted in the orientation we want to see it, but at the same time
% preserve the real data points and their relationships to one another:


%% Flip the Y axis upside down:

figure; plot(getd(pos,'x'),getd(pos,'y'),'.','Color',[0.7 0.7 0.7],'MarkerSize',4); xlabel('x data'); ylabel('y data');
set(gca,'YDir','reverse') % this flips the Y axis
title('This mazeis rightside up')


%% You can also rotate the maze:

figure; plot(getd(pos,'x'),getd(pos,'y'),'.','Color',[0.7 0.7 0.7],'MarkerSize',4); xlabel('x data'); ylabel('y data');
set(gca,'YDir','reverse') % this flips the Y axis
view(270,90); % the number 270 rotates the plot 270 degrees CLOCKWISE
title('Figure rotated AND flipped')

% Note that you can also perform this flip rotation by plotting (y,x), but
% this also transposes the data and works only for mazes that are bilaterally 
% symmetrical in the y axis (I think >_<).

% BACKGROUND INFORMATION

% You might need to load position data in centimeters instead of in units
% of pixels.

% Do do this, you need the real dimensions of your track in cm but these 
% dimensions must be as if the track fits perfectly into a box that has the 
% same orientation as the camera's field of view (the box has to be orthogonal 
% to the field of view, or whatever word it is). See digrams below.

% Furthermore, the dimesions should be measured according to the trajectory
% the rat would have followed, ie: don't measure from one outer edge to the
% opposite outer edge, because the rat doesn't walk along the edge -- he
% walks along the center (unless he's an acrobat or weird).

% rhombus track ex: you don't want lengths a and b, you want x and y 

%    |.... x ....|

%   field of view

% R050's T-maze is already approx lined up with the camera's field of view, so x = a and y = b

% The dimensions should be saved in your ExpKeys as:
%           ExpKeys.realTrackDims = [xWidth yWidth];

%% Now get the conversion factors using the function PosCon()

% PosCon() will reorient your maze if you pass in certain varargins. 
% read the help documentation on PosCon for more intructions
% If you recorded in RR1 you should always flip the Y axis unless LoadPos() 
% is changed to load the Y data differently

realTrackDims = [185 167]; % x width and y width in centimeters

convFact = PosCon(pos,realTrackDims,'XDir','reverse');

% You should save convFact in ExpKeys
%          ExpKeys.convFact = [xConvFact yConvFact];

% collected above:

coordL_cm = coordL; % copy coordL under a new variable name, and apply some changes:

% coord can be saved as a metadata field, and metadata can be saved as a

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Here's a quick example of how to linearize the position data. You can
% think of linearizing as "pushing the position data onto the nearest point
% along the coord trajectory". 

% Normally you would have a separate script that defines the trial start
% and stop times; for the sake of this example, here are the trial
% intervals for all right trials that R050 did for the example session:
load('Int_file.mat')
IntR = Int(find(Int(:,3)==0),:);

tstart = IntR(:,1)./1e6;
tend   = IntR(:,8)./1e6;

trial_iv_R = iv(tstart,tend);

clear tstart tend

%% Load position data in units of centimeters

% do do this, you need to specify conFact as a config field
cfg.convFact = convFact;

pos = LoadPos(cfg);


%% Now, restrict the position data to the right trials only:

pos_R = restrict(pos,trial_iv_R);

% You can plot the output to see what this looks like:
figure; plot(getd(pos_R,'x'),getd(pos_R,'y')); set(gca,'XDir','reverse')

% note that the lines connecting the end of the right arm to the start of
% the track are not actually present in the data...they are just artifacts
% of plotting.

%% Linearize the position data 

% pass the coord in via the config
cfg.Coord = coord.coordR_cm;

% use LinearizePos()
pos_R_lin = LinearizePos(cfg,pos_R);

figure; plot(getd(pos_R_lin,'z'),getd(pos_R_lin,'z_dist')); xlabel('z'); ylabel('z dist');

% pos_R_lin.data(1), the z (or linearized position data), is the same
% regardless of whether you load position data in centimeters or pixels.
% pos_R_lin.data(2), the z dist (or the amount the real position was
% displaced when it was pushed onto z) is different depending on the units
% you choose when loading pos.

% check by looking for t-junction, that values are similarly placed
tjunction = IntR(:,5)./1e6;
tjunTimes = dsearchn(pos_R.tvec',tjunction);
linearPosT = pos_R_lin.data(1,tjunTimes);

figure(); plot(pos_R.data(1,:),pos_R.data(2,:)); hold on;
yT = pos_R.data(2,tjunTimes);
xT = pos_R.data(1,tjunTimes);
scatter(xT,yT,'r','o');
title('Notice that its not exact, but pretty darn close')

% this below gives you the exact timestamp vector in pos_R
for i = 1:length(trial_iv_R.tstart)
    timingComp{i} = pos.tvec(pos.tvec >= trial_iv_R.tstart(i) & pos.tvec <= trial_iv_R.tend(i));
end
timeCol = horzcat(timingComp{:});

%% get spiking data into the same vector
ci = 1;
clusters   = dir('TT*.txt');

clear spikeTimes numSpikes timeDiff firingRate
spikeTimes = textread(clusters(ci,:).name);

% convert to sec
spk.times     = spikeTimes./1e6;
spk.timeConv  = 'sec';

% get spikes into one vector
spk.bool = zeros(size(pos.tvec));

% do a nearest search
spkSearch = dsearchn(pos.tvec',spk.times);

% replace data
spk.bool(spkSearch) = 1;

% get instantaneous time
srate = 30;
spk.instant_time = repmat(1/srate,size(spk.bool));

% place together with position
idxR = dsearchn(pos.tvec',pos_R.tvec');

% get spikes in that window
spk.posR_lin(1,:) = pos_R_lin.data(1,:);
spk.posR_lin(2,:) = pos_R_lin.data(2,:);
spk.posR_lin(3,:) = spk.bool(idxR);

% now find a way to group the bins! group by bin number, except don't break
% the order of the data.

%% calculate instantaneous velocity between linear bins!
