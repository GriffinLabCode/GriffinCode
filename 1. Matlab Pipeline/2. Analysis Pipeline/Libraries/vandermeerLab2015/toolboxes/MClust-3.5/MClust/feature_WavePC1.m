% [wavePCData, wavePCNames, wavePCPar] = feature_wavePC1(V, ttChannelValidity, Params)
% Calculate first waveform PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS  (PC1)
% if called with 2 arguments it recalcs the PC parameters,
% if called with 3 arguments it takes the PC parameters from the 3rd input
%
% INPUTS
%    V = TT tsd
%    ttChannelValidity = nCh x 1 of booleans
%    Params = 4x1 CellArray struct with fields
%             Params{}.pc (eigenvectos),
%             Params{}.av (averages),
%             Params{}.sd (std deviations)
%
% OUTPUTS
%    Data - nSpikes x nPC*nCh  of waveform PCs of each spike for each valid channel
%    Names - "wavePCn: Ch"
%    wavePCPar - 4x1 cell array struct of Parameters; fields same as Params input above
