%% get T-maze photobeam timestamps and reward delivery timestamps

% condense ts down to single passage events, or w/e
% find where the difference in timestamps is larger than 1s. We'll say this
% border contitues different passages. However, this misses the last
% passage, so keep the last timestamp to represent the last passage. Prob

% don't know what to call this next bit:
% make a matrix containing zeros in place of ts. replace the zeros with 1s
% where L pb is broken, 2s for C pb, and 3s for R pb.

tvec_task = tvec(task); % restrict tvec to task times only
