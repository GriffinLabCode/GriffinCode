function SWRtimes = ducktrap(cfg_in,S,csc)
% DUCKTRAP Manually identify windows containing sharp wave-ripple
% complexes. The default window is 0.08 seconds (80 milliseconds).
%
% function SWRtimes = ducktrap(cfg,S,csc) plots S (spiketrain) and csc (LFP) 
% and allows the user to manually identify SWRs by clicking on the figure to 
% produce a containment window (trapwin). Upon clicking, trapwin will be
% plotted on the figure as a blue horizontal line. To keep the SWR time,
% press enter. Trapwin will change to green and remain on the plot. The
% function will return output when the user collects the number of SWR
% times specified by cfg.num.
%
% User can move viewing window via keyboard input in the same general manner as 
% MultiRaster (type "help navigate" in command window). *** some navigate
% features may not compatible with ducktrap.
%
% For more information, open ducktrap and the read the section "About ducktrap".
%
%
%   INPUTS:
%       cfg_in: input cfg
%       S: spiketrain struct. Output from LoadSpikes.
%       csc: tsd object (LFP). Output from LoadCSC.
%
%   OUTPUT
%       SWRtimes: iv struct with fields:
%           .tcent   - actual click times; this is the important one
%           .tstart  - [num x 1 double] start times
%           .tend    - [num x 1 double] end times
%           .trapwin - window width used to "catch" SWRs.
%           .label   - the csc used for identification
%
%       ducktrap_backup - [1 x numKept double]; transient variable
%              containing x-axis values clicked by the user. It exists in 
%              the base workspace while the function is running, and 
%              remains only if the function does not reach completion.  
%
%   CFG OPTIONS:
%
%       cfg.trapwin - default 0.08 seconds (80 milliseconds). The window for
%           containing individual SWRs manually identified by the user. It
%           is the same window that will be used in SWRfreak and detectSWR.
%
%       cfg.num - default 50. The number of SWRs you would like to
%           manually identify.
%
%       cfg.evt - default NONE
%           Event data in iv format. The output from getSWR or a similar function.
%           Useful for viewing "loud" SWRs with few false positives if the
%           detection threshold was properly set; may help identify
%           positives. 
%
%       cfg.lfpHeight - default 15 
%           The height of the lfp (csc) from maximum to minium in y-axis units. Vertically 
%           stretches the lfp to improve visibility of oscillations.  
%
%       cfg.lfpMax - default 15
%           Values greater than lfpMax times above mean(abs(lfp.data)) will be plotted 
%           as NaNs. Improves visibilty by cutting off high-amplitude [noise] blips 
%           in raw lfp.

%% About ducktrap 

% Ducktrap was designed to be used as the first step in identifying SWRs
% using the discrete Fourier transform. The identified SWRs are used by
% the next function to find Fourier cofficients for SWRs. 
%
% SETTING UP DUCKTRAP:
%
% please = cfg.useClustersFile = 0;
% S = LoadSpikes(please);
% cfg.fc = {'R050-2014-04-02-CSC07a.ncs};
% csc = LoadCSC(cfg);
% evt_getSWR = getSWR(cfg,S,csc);
% cfg.evt = evt_getSWR;
% SWRtimes = ducktrap(cfg,S,csc);

% HOW TO USE DUCKTRAP:
%
% SWRtimes = ducktrap(cfg,S,csc);
%
% A figure will open that displays the entire csc and S.
% Use keyboard input to navigate to different areas of the plot ("help
% navigate"). If you've plotted evt produced by power thresholding, this
% can help you identify positives. Without evt, nagivate will move the
% window in units of seconds using the keys A and D. 
% When you see a SWR you want to keep, click on its centerpoint and trapwin
% will appear on the screen as a horizontal blue bar. If the trapwin
% seems properly placed, type Enter and the trapwin will change
% to green. If you do not want to keep the selection, then press another 
% key or click elsewhere. Once you've hit Enter, there's no way to undo the
% choice, so don't mess up :P The figure legend keeps track of how many
% SWR times you've collected. If you accidentally close the figure, you can
% access your previous clicks in ducktrap_backup, but you need to -/+
% trapwin/2 to get the interval.
%
% Ducktrap's output can be sent into SWRfreak to get the Fourier
% coefficients of the sum of your manually identified SWRs. 
%
% WHY DO I HAVE TO SPECIFY NUM2CATCH?
%
% Because AC sucks at programming, and couldn't get the function to work
% unless there was some way to terminate the while loop cleanly. If you
% don't know how many SWRs you want to get, then specify a large num
% and close the figure when you're done. This will generate errors. But you
% can still get the SWR center times from ducktrap_backup in the base workspace.
%
% WHY IS IT CALLED DUCKTRAP?
% It's a joke based on an analogy that EGrant gave me about power 
% thresholding finding only the loudest SWRs; it's like recording from ducks
% but only being able to detect the loudest quacks... 
%
%%
% DUCKTRAP: THE STORY
%
% There once was a lowly biologist who liked to stalk ducks. She recorded 
% the sounds of the ducks, which were neighbours to the geese and the noisy
% waterfall. Later, she wanted to count how many times the ducks quacked, 
% but more often than not her detection would only find the loudest ducks, 
% and sometimes it would also detect the pesky geese (that incidentally also 
% liked to shit everywhere with no regard for public decency). So, the lowly 
% biologist complained to the arrogant mathematician in passing.
% 
% And he told her, “You biologists are so dumb, you’re probably doing 
% something like filtering the signal and looking for high power in a single 
% ripple band. If you’re just thresholding over a single frequency band you’ll 
% miss all the quiet ducks and detect all the loud geese as false positives”.
% 
% And her response was something along the lines of, “I know: I’m a lowly 
% biologist. I’m worse than lowly. In fact, I’m a plebian—no, a platyhelminth! 
% An intestinal parasite!”
% 
% Somehow this activated the arrogant mathematician’s math superiority complex, 
% “Look, if you want to find the quiet ducks, too, here’s how you should do it. 
% First, find me at least 100 real ducks.”
% 
% Supremely grateful (but also a smidgen annoyed by the arrogant mathematician’s 
% arrogance), the lowly [intestinal] biologist set out to rob ducks of
% their freedom.
