%% Cluster stability function
% This function calculates mean peak voltage for spikes recorded on tetrodes
% by first choosing the electrode with the largest mean amplitude peak,
% extracting that channel within a specific time frame in the beginning
% and end of a session, taking the mean of the specified timeframes 
% individually and comparing the two.
%
% This script may not be extremely generalizable without specific storing
% of your data. However, the content of how I determined cluster stability
% from neural data could be useful.
%
% IMPORTANT: I had to save the Nlx2MatSpike .mex and .m file to each
%               session folder. There's probably a more efficient way.
%
% INPUTS: Datafolders: a string variable containing the directory for 
%                       all sessions
%
%         time_window: a scalar containing a single value in minutes (i.e.
%                       time_window = 10; tells the function to examine the
%                       first and last ten minutes of the recording.
%
%         vt_name: the name of video tracking file. Often 'VT1.mat'
%
%         missing_data: how to handle missing video tracking data. Options
%                        are 'interp','ignore','exclude'. Its best to just
%                        ignore for this function because we only care
%                        about first and last timestamps
%
% OUTPUTS: neuron is a N(cluster) x 3 struct array containing cluster
%           name, mean pre peak in volts, and mean post peak in volts.
%          pre_peak_data and post_peak_data are variables extracted 
%           from the struct array 'neuron' and converted to uV
