getVTdata: This function was written to provide user-friendly access to video tracking data recorded from your experiment.

		Note, you must have already converted your data:
			- go to ...\GitHub\GriffinCode\1. Matlab Pipeline\1. Formatting Data\Int Creation and follow the 
				protocol written there

Pixels2Measurement: A function that allows the user to convert pixel data to the measurement of their choosing. For example,
			if you wanted to calculate velocity and you are using your VT data, the data in its raw form is in 
			pixels, and therefore velocity = pixels/sec. However, you might want to convert your pixel data to 
			cm or m or inches, so that velocity calculation is then in cm/sec m/sec or inch/sec.

SUPPORT FUNCTIONS:

correct_tracking_errors: An attempt to correct non-zero tracking errors
interp_missing_VTdata: Interpolates missing data (zero valued tracking errors). This is the most common kind of tracking error.
exclude_missing_VTdata: Detects any missing data (zero valued tracking data errors) and removes them
ignore_missing_VTdata: does not perform a function to VT data

**Note that all of these functions format the data in a manner that allows for smooth access to most old data. For example, over 
the years, name changes occurred, making it difficult to apply newly created code to old data without changing names. These methods
allow for use of old data without worrying about their names.

***IF NAME BASED ERROR OCCURS ***
If there is data where the name requested by matlab is different from what the data were named (e.g. you expect the data
to be named ExtractedX, but it is named ExtractedX_VT_data), then you will need to include the name variability to the current
code.
