To get started:

1) view_VT_data 
	Make sure that the square spaces capture startbox, stem, 
	choice-point, and goal-zones.
	
	**If you are getting missing data type tracking errors, 
	you probably need to make the square spaces larger in area.
	Also, you probably have a lot of tracking errors. You can 
	try missing_data = 'interp', however, it will not be better than
	fixing your video tracking

2) Run Int_DAorCA_master OR Int_DNMP_master
	Make sure you have the file 'Int_information' stored in your
	datafolder of interest prior to using


*** IMPORTANT ***

CHECK YOUR INT FILE!!!

In the Int_** code, it will ask if you want to check your data.
Absolutely do this! Sometimes, an extra trial will be logged.

->>>>>> IF USING THE AUTOMAZE <<<<<<<<-

** important ** 
Old versions of the automaze lack sophistication with the IR beam
generating the Int file. This just makes us take some extra steps 
(see below). Automaze needs some hardware updates (eg IR beam additions)
and software updates (creating the Int file in real time)

1) Run Int_automaze_DA (will need to craft differently for other tasks)
2) Run Int_hybrid (PLEASE CHECK THAT YOUR DATA IS CORRECT!)
	-> Red lines indicate stem entry to cp exit
	-> Black is the rest
3) Run Int_vs_autoAccuracy to cross-validate

CODE:

checkInt: a Script used to flip through trials and check the int file by plotting trajectories
identify_trajectory_divergence: A way to manually select the choice divergence point
Int_automaze_DA: create Int file using IR beams
Int_DAorCA_bigMaze: used to create Int file on larger, non automated maze
Int_DNMP_bigMaze: Used to create int file for DNMP task on non-automated maze
Int_hybrid: Used to create int file on automaze - used in combination with Int_automaze_DA
Int_vs_autoAccuracy: Used to cross-validate Int file with automaze accuracy variable
view_VT_data: All variants are to plot boxes around VT data - this is required to generate the Int file
	as it sets the boundaries (eg what is stem entry vs cp exit)
whereishe_master: used for the big maze
