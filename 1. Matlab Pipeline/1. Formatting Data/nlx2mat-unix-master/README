This directory contains a port of the neuralynx file readers for CSC and
EV files. This linux port is based on the original windows/MFC version, developed by Neuralynx.

There are two versions: One for 32 Bit and one for 64 Bit. Scripts are provided for Linux and Mac OS X, 
adaptation to other operating systems (with gcc) should, however, be possible fairly easily.

Execute either compile32.sh or compile64.sh, depending on your platform (Linux).
For Mac OS X, execute compile32_mac.sh or compile64_mac.sh .

Important:
Before you compile, copy either compatibility64.h or compatibility32.h to compatibility.h . 

Testing:
The 32-bit version was tested on:
Ubuntu Linux, g++ 4.2.3, Matlab 7.6 (and higher)

The 64-bit linux version was tested on:
Redhat Linux EL5, g++ 4.1.2 and Matlab 7.6 (and higher) 

The 32-bit Mac OS X version was tested on:
Mac OS X 10.5, g++ 4.0.1 and Matlab 2007b

The 64-bit Mac OS X version was tested on:
Mac OS X 10.5, g++ 4.0.1 and Matlab 2009a

Note: The version of Matlab installed determines whether you need the 32/64 version and not the operating system. 
If you're not sure whether your matlab is 32 or 64 bits, type 'computer' on the matlab prompt.
 
Parameters:
the path of matlab is set in compile[32/64].sh (first two variables)

Compilation:
execute compile32.sh or compile64.sh

setup:
compile.sh generates the two files Nlx2MatCSC_v3.mexglx and Nlx2MatEV_v3.mexglx. Put these two files in a directory that is in the
matlab search path (or add the new path to the matlab search path). The functions have the same syntax and functionality as the windows
versions. Help is available from within matlab with 'help Nlx2MatCSC_v3' or 'help Nlx2MatEV_v3'.

The file ending will be mexa64 for 64-bit, mexmaci for 32-bit mac and mexmaci64 for 64-bit mac (instead of mexglx as stated above).

Three example matlab files are included:
getRawCSCData.m  : reads raw signal from a CSC file
getRawCSCTimestamps.m : reads timestamps from a CSC file
getRawTTLs.m: reads TTLS from an event file

example of reading an event file:
events = getRawTTLs('Events.Nev');

reading csc data:
[timestamps,dataSamples] = getRawCSCData( 'a8.ncs', 198, 200 );


!! Note: If the mex function gives errors such as "Corrupt file - incomplete record encountered" it means you compiled
the wrong version or used the wrong compatibility.h (wrong architecture, as when using the 32bit version for 64). 
DO NOT ignore this warning - the data returnend is corrupt!

First release:
June 2004, Ueli Rutishauser, California Institute of Technology, Computation and Neural Systems, 
urut@caltech.edu

Second release:
October 2008, Updated to 64-Bit and newer g++ compiler (also for 32-bit version).

third release:
August 2009, minor update for mac os x 64-bit. Also, modified StdString.h to make it compile with the latest g++ without warnings (this->).
