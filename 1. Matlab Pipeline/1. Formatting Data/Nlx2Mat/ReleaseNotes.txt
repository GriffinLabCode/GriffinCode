*	Matlab Import/Export MEX files Release Notes
*
*********************************************

****************
* v5.0.1
****************
Fixed Bugs:
-All Nlx2Mat MEX files can now read files larger than 2GB.

****************
* v5.0.0
****************
Added Features:
-Now supports reading and writing a single channel of raw data (NRD) files via Nlx2MatNRD and Mat2NlxNRD.
-Mat2NlxSpike has replaced Mat2NlxSE, Mat2NlxST and Mat2NlxTT.
-All Mat2Nlx commands no longer take a number of output records as an argument. The number of output records is determined by the data being exported.

General Changes:
-All Mat2Nlx functions now create a generic header for the output file if none is specified.
-All Mat2Nlx and Nlx2Mat functions now use one (1) based indexing (i.e. the first record is now record 1 not 0).
-Improved help documentation
-Improved error messages.

Fixed Bugs:
-All Nlx2Mat functions now import correct record indices when using extraction mode 3 (record list)
-All Nlx2Mat functions now import correct record if a timestamp occurs within a record when using modes 4 (timestamp range) and 5 (timestamp list).

****************
* v4.1.3
****************
Fixed Bugs:
-Nlx2MatSpike now correctly imports all subchannel data for tetrodes and stereotrodes.
-Nlx2MatEV now properly handles TTL values when bit 15 is high.

****************
* v4.1.2
****************
General Changes:
-Requires Matlab R2006b (7.3) or newer

Fixed Bugs:
-Mat2NlxEV no longer crashes when exporting without a header.
-Nlx2Mat functions no longer increase memory usage with every call.
-Nlx2Mat functions using import modes 4 and 5 now import the record before a requested timestamp if a record doesn't start with the requested timestamp.

****************
* v4.1.1
****************
General Changes:
-Import MEX files now read files that contain records that have out of order timestamps.
-Updated some errors in the help documentation.


****************
* v4.1.0
****************
Added Features:
-64bit Matlab support

General Changes:
-Changed to new MEX file format (R2008a)
